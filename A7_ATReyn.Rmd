### Setup

Load libraries:
```{r}

library(ape)
library(reshape2)
library(ggplot2)
library(ggtree)
library(dplyr)


```

Load data:
```{r}

DragonNexus <- read.nexus.data("./Input/DragonMatrix.nex")

# Examine the data
tail(DragonNexus)
names(DragonNexus)


```

Import premade weights:
```{r}

WeightsDat <- read.csv("./Input/Weights.csv")

```

### Apply Trait Weighting

1. Create a single vector of weights
```{r}

# Isolate weight values from dataset
Weights <- paste0(WeightsDat$Weight, collapse = "")

# Split weights into vector
Weights <- strsplit(Weights, split = "")[[1]]

```


2. Convert each letter to its corresponding weight value (e.g. A=10, B=11, etc.)
```{r}

# Convert weights to letter values
WeightsNum <- rep(NA, length(Weights))
for(i in 1:length(WeightsNum)){
  if(Weights[i] %in% LETTERS){
    WeightsNum[i] <- which(LETTERS == Weights[i]) + 9 # Add 9 to get weight values (A=10, B=11, etc.)
  } else {
    WeightsNum[i] <- Weights[i]
  }
}

# Create list of weights
WeightsNum <- as.numeric(WeightsNum)

# Check to see if it is appropriate length (78)
length(WeightsNum)


```

3. Multiply the weight value by the trait vector for each dragon
```{r}

# Slice object:
WtDragonNexus <- DragonNexus # Make a new weighted data frame object

# Multiply weight value by trait vector for each dragon
for (i in 1:length(DragonNexus)){
  RepWeight <- DragonNexus[[i]] == 1
  WtDragonNexus[[i]][RepWeight] <- WeightsNum[RepWeight]
  RepWeight <- NA
}


```

4. Re-calculate our distance matrix
```{r}

# Modify objects
WtDragonNexusDF <- data.frame(matrix(unlist(WtDragonNexus), ncol = length(DragonNexus[[1]]), byrow = T))

row.names(WtDragonNexusDF) <- names(WtDragonNexus)

WtDragonDist <- dist(WtDragonNexusDF, method = 'euclidean')

# Create dist()
WtDragonDistMat <- as.matrix(WtDragonDist)

# Create dist matrix
WtPDat <- melt(WtDragonDistMat)

# Plot distance matrix
ggplot(data = WtPDat, aes(x = Var1, y = Var2, fill = value)) + 
  geom_tile() +
  scale_fill_gradientn(colours = c("white", "blue", "green", "red")) +
  theme(axis.text.x = element_text(angle = 90, hjust = 1, vjust = 0.5))


```

### Plotting the Tree

```{r}

# Minimal evolution (ME) setup
WtDragonTreeME <- fastme.bal(WtDragonDist)

# Neighbour-joining (NJ) setup
WtDragonTreeNJ <- nj(WtDragonDist)

# Compare circular trees
ggtree(WtDragonTreeME, layout = "circular")
ggtree(WtDragonTreeNJ, layout = "circular")

```
The Minimal Evolution method looks the best, so I will further format that tree.

### Tree Formatting

Creating a tree based on identity of dragons:
```{r}

# Parse out vector
Country <- gsub("[0-9\\.]+([^X]+)X*", "\\1", WtDragonTreeME$tip.label) # Remove leading numbers

# Group tip.labels by country
CountryGroups <- split(WtDragonTreeME$tip.label, Country)

# Use groupOTU to group dragons (Operational Taxonomic Unit--we assign taxonomic groups, may not be spp, cluster based on similarities)
WtDTcol <- groupOTU(WtDragonTreeME, CountryGroups)

# Change tip label names
WtDTcol$tip.label <- paste(Country, seq(1:length(WtDTcol$tip.label)), sep = "")

# New tree
IDTree <- ggtree(WtDTcol, layout = "rectangular", aes(colour = group)) +
  geom_tiplab(size = 2, aes(angle = 0)) +
  scale_colour_discrete(name = "Identity",
                      labels = c("Unknown", "American", "British", "DRAGON 1", "DRAGON 2", "DRAGON 3", 
                                 "Dutch", "English", "FISH", "French", "German", "Greek", "Indian",
                                 "Iranian", "Italian", "Japanese", "MAMMAL", "Russian", "SNAKE", "Spanish",
                                 "Turkish", "Ukranian")) +
  geom_point2(aes(subset = (node == 53)), shape = 17, size = 1, colour = "red") +  # Highlights my dragons
  geom_point2(aes(subset = (node == 54)), shape = 17, size = 1, colour = "red") +
  geom_point2(aes(subset = (node == 43)), shape = 17, size = 1, colour = "red")


```

Creating a tree based on clade:
```{r}

# Create list of nodes for clade grouping
WtDTclade <- groupClade(WtDragonTreeME,.node = c(110, 134, 120))

# Create tree
CladeTree <- ggtree(WtDTclade,layout = "circular", aes()) + 
  geom_cladelabel(node = 110, label = "Serpentidae", hjust = 0.15, offset.text = 4, fontsize = 3) + # Label clades
  geom_cladelabel(node = 134, label = "Orientalia", hjust = 0.35, offset.text = 4, fontsize = 3) +
  geom_cladelabel(node = 120, label = "Dracopteronidae", hjust = 0.55, 
                  vjust = 4, offset.text = 4, fontsize = 3) +
  geom_cladelabel(node = 83, label = "Wyvernidae", hjust = 0.6, offset.text = 4, fontsize = 3) +
  geom_hilight(node = 110, fill = "gold", alpha = 0.2) + # Highlight clades
  geom_hilight(node = 83, fill = "purple", alpha = 0.2) +
  geom_hilight(node = 134, fill = "cyan", alpha = 0.2) + 
  geom_hilight(node = 120, fill = "green", alpha = 0.2) +
  geom_point2(aes(subset = (node == 53)), shape = 17, size = 3, colour = "red") + # Highlights my dragons
  geom_point2(aes(subset = (node == 54)), shape = 17, size = 3, colour = "red") +
  geom_point2(aes(subset = (node == 43)), shape = 17, size = 3, colour = "red")

```

### Discussion

\n

I have selected three dragons to include in a revised Dragon Phylogeny, as shown below.

**Dragon 3:** Amphiptere by [Edward Topsell](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amphiptere#/media/File:Amphiptere.jpg).

\n
\n

Based on my generated phylogeny, using the minimal evolution method, these dragons are relatively closely related despite their visual differences, fitting in with dragons of Japanese, Russian, Ukranian, French, Turkish, and American origin, as well as a morphologically typical "snake" group (Fig. 1). Oddly enough, Dragon 1 appears to be more closely related to Dragon 2, even though they have several striking differences, such as body coverings and the presence or absence of wings. Additionally, although all three new dragons being of European origin (Nordic, German, and English, respectively) they appear rather closely related to Japanese dragons, likely due to their elongate tails and serpentine bodies.

In fact, the three newly added dragons all belong to the same clade, the Dracopternidae (Fig. 2). Named for the winged dragons that are found within this clade, the Dracopternidae contains multiple accounts of independent evolutions of wings, with some dragon species exhibit the highly conserved trait of being wingless. For example, both Dragon 2 and Dragon 3 would have had to evolve wings independently of one another, as their last common ancestor would have been wingless.

In contrast to the original Dragon Phylogeny, Wyvernidae and Dracoversidae are much more closely related groups, and thus species belonging to Dracoversidae have been reclassified as Wyvernidae.
